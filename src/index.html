	<h1>Cultural Differences</h1>
	<p>When traveling to Korea from a Western country, it's important to be mindful of certain cultural differences to ensure a respectful and enjoyable experience. Here are some key cultural differences to be aware of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hierarchy and Respect: Korean culture places a strong emphasis on hierarchy and respect for authority, age, and social status. It's customary to use formal language (honorifics) when speaking to elders or those in positions of authority. Bowing is also a common form of greeting and showing respect.</li>
		<li>Personal Space: Koreans tend to have a smaller personal space bubble compared to Westerners. It's not uncommon for people to stand closer together while conversing or waiting in line. Be mindful of personal space boundaries and adjust your behavior accordingly.</li>
		<li>Removing Shoes Indoors: In Korean homes, traditional restaurants, and even some businesses like spas and guesthouses, it's customary to remove your shoes before entering. Look for a designated area to leave your shoes or follow the lead of locals.</li>
		<li>Dining Etiquette: When dining in Korea, there are certain etiquette rules to follow. Wait to be seated, use both hands when giving or receiving items (such as money or business cards), and never stick your chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice, as it resembles a funeral ritual.</li>
		<li>Silence on Public Transportation: Unlike in some Western countries where conversations on public transportation are common, Koreans generally maintain a quiet atmosphere on buses and subways. Keep noise levels low and avoid speaking loudly or using your phone in crowded spaces.</li>
	</ul>
